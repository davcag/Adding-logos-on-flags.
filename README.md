# Adding-logos-on-flags.
Scrapes flags of all the countries from https://www.countries-ofthe-world.com/flags-of-the-world.html, adds a logo over them and uploads them. 

First use getFlags.py, then makeFlags.py to add the logo over them and then it can be uploaded with uploadFlags.py. 

The upload uses pyautogui to upload the flags, so click positions and number of clicks will have to be modified depending on the user.
